From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don&amp;rsquo;t follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release ;)
As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series.</description></item><item><title>Reviews | 1.19 Pre-Release 1</title><link>https://ran-n.github.io/minecraft_info/en/minecraft/versions/java/information/1.19pre1/reviews/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 22:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ran-n.github.io/minecraft_info/en/minecraft/versions/java/information/1.19pre1/reviews/</guid><description>Reviews | 1.19 Pre-Release 1 1.19 Pre-Release 1 xisumavoid Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 1 - Mob Spawn Changes &amp;amp; New Vibrations wattles WILD UPDATE VERY SOON!
