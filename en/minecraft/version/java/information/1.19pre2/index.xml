We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.</description></item><item><title>Reviews | 1.19 Pre-Release 2</title><link>https://ran-n.github.io/minecraft_info/en/minecraft/versions/java/information/1.19pre2/reviews/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 18:33:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ran-n.github.io/minecraft_info/en/minecraft/versions/java/information/1.19pre2/reviews/</guid><description>Reviews | 1.19 Pre-Release 2 1.19 Pre-Release 2 xisumavoid Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2 - The End Of Portal Farms? -- Rays Works Mojang BROKE my Best Farms! 1.19 Pre 2 &amp;amp; 3 Review --</description></item></channel></rss>
