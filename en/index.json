Keeping up with the times!\nHappy mining!\nNew Features  Added the Deep Dark biome Added Frogs \u0026amp; Tadpoles Added mangrove blocks Added mud and mud brick blocks Added Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker and Sculk Catalyst blocks Added 3D Directional Audio option  Deep Dark Dig into the depths far underground to uncover the darkest biome in Minecraft - the Deep Dark.\n Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the most brave player The floor of the Deep Dark is covered in sculk No mobs spawn in the Deep Dark  Frog  Frogs can jump Frogs can swim Frogs can walk on land Frogs can croak Frogs can eat small slimes, causing a slime ball to drop Frogs can eat small Magma Cubes, causing a Froglight block to drop Each Frog variant drops a specific Froglight Block Three Froglight blocks are added, a lightsource block  Tadpoles  Tadpoles can swim in water Tadpoles on land “jump around” like fishes on land, and eventually dies Tadpoles that grows up turns into a Frog Tadpoles grow into a different type of frog based on the biome they are born in (Cold, Temperate, Warm) Tadpoles can be caught in a bucket  Mangrove Wood Blocks Added a new type of wood: Mangrove! Mangrove biome + mangrove trees are coming in a later snapshot.\n Mangrove log and stripped mangrove log Mangrove wood and stripped mangrove wood Mangrove roots and muddy mangrove roots Mangrove boat, button, pressure plate, door, trapdoor, sign, slab, fence, fence gate, and stairs  Mangrove Leaves and Propagules  Mangrove propagule is a sapling that grows from the bottom of mangrove leaves Bonemealing mangrove leaves will cause a new propagule to start growing beneath it Propagules grow through 4 stages, and growth can be accelerated by bonemealing You can break off a fully grown propagule and plant it like a sapling. For now it will grow in an oak tree, but will of course grow into a mangrove tree when that is done.  Mud  Mud is a block that will generate in the upcoming Mangrove biome. When walking on mud, entities sink down a bit. Like soul sand, but without the slowdown. Mud can be created by using a water bottle on dirt, by hand or with a dispenser. Packed mud can be crafted from mud  Mud Bricks  Mud bricks are a building block that can be crafted from packed mud Mud bricks can be crafted into Mud brick stairs, walls, and slabs using a crafting table or stonecutter.  Sculk The rattling tendrils of the Sculk Sensors had to come from somewhere, right? Introducing Sculk, a new family of blocks that dwells in the Deep Dark.\n  Added Sculk Catalyst block, a mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms with Sculk patches underneath nearby dying mobs\n Mobs that perish in the presence of the catalyst will not drop their experience    Added Sculk blocks\n When a mob dies near a Sculk Catalyst, some unknown process seems to consume blocks beneath and turn them into Sculk blocks Sculk charge when spreading will have a chance to grow certain blocks, like Sculk Sensors on top of it, consuming its charge.    Added Sculk Vein blocks\n These veins are found on the edge of Sculk patches Similar to Glow Lichen, they can be placed in any orientation Spreading of veins causes other blocks to be taken over by the sculk Sculk Vein can spread underwater    Added Sculk Shrieker block.\n Sculk Shriekers can be found growing rarely from the charge of a Sculk Catalyst Sculk Shrieker can be waterlogged Sculk Shrieker requires Silk Touch to obtain otherwise drops experience when mined    Souls from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk Blocks in random directions until they find a valid substrate they can feed of off\n The charge from souls in the Sculk Blocks and Sculk Veins will eventually decay, but it will decay much, much slower in the close vicinity of the Sculk Catalyst, and much faster away from its host If the charge is dropped outside the range of the Catalyst, it has a chance of growing a Sculk Sensor    Sculk, Sculk Veins and Sculk Catalysts require Silk Touch to acquire. Otherwise, they drop experience when mined\n The efficient tool for all Sculk family blocks is the Hoe    3D Directional Audio  Added sound option for 3D Directional Audio simulation This option is best experienced with headphones  Technical Changes  The data pack format is now 10 The resource pack format is now 9 Added 3D Blending Added new font glyph provider for spaces Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and F3 debug screen  This is only available for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries   Added ability for data and resource packs to selectively hide files from packs below them World presets/types and flat world presets in “Create World” screen can now be controlled by datapacks Added server property max-chained-neighbor-updates to limit the amount of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones. Negative values remove the limit.  Blending  Blending now support 3d biome blending, so it will blend the underground biomes as well. Removed blending_data.old_noise, now existence of blending_data in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old Added blending_data.min_section and blending_data.max_section that determines which sections will be used for data for blending  Space Glyph Provider  New glyph provider type space is added to allow creation of space-like glyphs New provider has single argument called advances which is map of codepoint to glyph advance (width) Rendering of space glyph is not longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font)  Paquete de filtros  Data and resource packs can have filter section in pack.mcmeta. This section has mandatory field block, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths. If any of files in packs added before one with filter section matches any pattern inside block, it will be filtered out (i.e. treated as if it wasn’t present in the first place). filter section does not apply to a pack containing it - only to packs loaded before it. Both namespace and path can be omited. Missing field matches every value. For example, adding pack with this section in pack.mcmeta after vanilla pack will hide all recipes and advancements defined by vanilla pack  \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;block\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;recipes/.*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;advancements/.*\u0026#34; } ] } World Presets  New registry types worldgen/world_preset and worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset were added to data-drive presents (like “Amplified” or “Single Biome”) Two tags for world presets added (normal and alternative) to control values show on “World Type” button in “Create World” screen One tag added for flat world presents (visible) to control order of elements displayed in “Configure Flat World” screen World presets can also be used as a value of level-type in server.properties  Predicates The feature field in location predicates is now called structure\nFixed Bugs   MC-67308 - Door top and side textures flip illogically when opened and closed.

It\u0026rsquo;s Wal\u0026hellip; wait that\u0026rsquo;s not it. It\u0026rsquo;s the warden! The spooky, unfriendly (maybe it just wants a hug?) mob is making its way into our latest snapshot.\nAdditionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing some functionality for the sculk shriekers and some fancy new boats (they have chests).\nEnjoy!\nNew Features  Added Darkness mob effect Added Sculk Shrieker functionality Added the Warden mob Added boat with chest Added the Swift Sneak enchantment  Sculk Shrieker  Added functionality to the Sculk Shrieker: Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens  Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!   Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you’ll hear it responding in the distance… Once it’s close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared! Added Warden mob  Warden The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome\n Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment When vibrations aren’t enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs To add to their myriad of ways to detect you, try not to get too close! If you collide with a Warden, it will notice you In the Deep Dark, Wardens are everywhere - you just can’t see them. They slumber beneath your feet, and only dig out when enough Sculk Shriekers have alerted them of your presence Watch your step: the more vibrations a Warden detects, the angrier it will get. You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden’s anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles  If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests   Unfortunately for all players, Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists They do not drop any loot Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you’ve been warned  Darkness  A new mob effect unique to the Warden and Sculk Shrieker, which will afflict you with it when nearby Lowers the gamma down at an equivalent of “Moody” while having this effect In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up against light sources When the Warden is around, torches will be more important than ever! A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”  Controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a Warden or Sculk Shrieker gives it to you, but will not affect the fog distance    Boat with chest  Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures If you are in the boat, press the open inventory key to access the chest contents If you are not in the boat, shift-right click to access the chest contents If you break the boat the chest contents will spill out, like with other chests Also works with hoppers, droppers, and other blocks that interact with chests Like other chests, opening a boat chest or breaking the boat will anger piglins, since they think all chests belong to them  Swift Sneak Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!\n When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking Has 3 different levels with different speed increases It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!  Changes  The Deep Dark biome is now less flooded than surrounding areas Leaves are now waterloggable Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance  Fixed Bugs   MC-149805 - While editing a book, you cannot use Ctrl\u0026#43;Home or Ctrl\u0026#43;End to jump to the beginning or end of the text.

Use it lightly and you’ll end up with terms like “Nincompoop” instead of “Cool dude” on your back. And to answer your question: yes, I am working on removing that tattoo, but it takes a while when all you have is soap and water!\nThe meaning of the above word is simple: “simplicity”. Since time immemorial, Mojang Studios have strived for simplistic perfection in our games, making simple updates with simple ideas to preserve the essence of Minecraft.\nHowever, recent player feedback has revealed that we have strayed from the path and lost sight of our values. We’re becoming, urgh, complex, and that needs to change! Effective immediately, we’re canceling all currently planned updates in favor of a much more basic one: the One Block at a Time Update.\n    -- Putting our blockiest minds on this monumental task, we have worked day and night to bring you the most profoundly simple update we have ever delivered – one with minimalistic features that take all the confusing complexity out of Minecraft. And who could explain the intricate details of this new and bold venture than our very own Chief Creative Officer, Jens “Jeb” Bergensten?\n Well said, Jeb!\nJens is not the only one we chased across the office hallways day and night for an exclusive quote. We were also successful in cornering Nir Vaknin, Minecraft developer and head of Aprilis Asinus, the team leading the One Block at a Time initiative, codenamed Project A Simple Ton of Blocks.\n“Players love to complain give us valuable feedback, said Nir while trying to slip past our reporter. And an exhausting incredible example of that is the many comments we got about inventory management and how it can be a pain to use. The answer was Simple™ – get rid of it!”\nBrilliant!!! Instead of adding new features to the game, Nir and team believe that Minecraft’s future will be about implementing smart reverse-engineering techniques, focusing more on removing features instead of coming up with new ones.\n“Minecraft has become too fast, too furious. Kids these days never take the time to smell the creepers anymore or appreciate things ONE BLOCK AT A TIME!”\nFeatures  Fixed all inventory issues by removing the inventory Made the whole world into a player inventory space Up to 14 quintillion inventory slots Also removed experience and enchanting, while we’re at it Fixed MC-4 by having no items on the ground Dropper drops. Droppier drops? Improved chest excitement factor \u0026gt;:) Added the ability to throw stuff. YEET! Glass is 50% more realistic when thrown Added wrestling moves as an alternative to leashes Reworked combat because it’s haaaard to create a more immersive gameplay experience Sneaky block?
