## New Features
- Added Allay mob
- Added Ancient Cities

## Changes
- The recipes for minecart with chest/furnace/tnt/hopper are now shapeless
- When broken each minecart variant drops itself as an item, instead of splitting into two items (such as chest and minecart)
- Only wool and wool carpets now block the sounds coming from noteblocks
